# chown command

- The `chown` command, short for “change owner,” is a powerful tool that allows users to change the owner of files and directories. This command is particularly useful in scenarios where administrators need to grant or revoke access to specific resources.
- An important thing to note is that only the root user can perform changing of permissions or ownerships of the files that are not owned by them.
- Regular users have limited access to files and directories and can only modify the files that they own.
