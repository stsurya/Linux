# Find Command

`Find` command in linux is used to search files and directories recursively looking for files that match given criteria such as name, size, modification time, permissions, and more.

**Syntax:**
`find [path] [options] [expression]`

**path:** Starting directory for the search.<br>
**Example:** find /path/to/search<br>

✅ Recursively means find searches inside subdirectories automatically.
✅ You don’t have to manually specify subdirectories.
✅ You can limit recursion using -maxdepth and -mindepth.
