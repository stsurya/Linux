# init command

- The init process is the parent of all processes in Linux, identified by the process ID (PID) of 1. It is the first process that starts when a computer boots up and continues to run until the system shuts down.
- The term init stands for “initialization,” and its primary role is to create and manage processes based on instructions from configuration scripts, specifically those stored in the ‘/etc/inittab‘ file.
