# usermod

After creating a user we've sometimes to change their attributes like password or directory e.t.c. So in order to do that we use the Usermod command.

The information of a user is stored in the following files:<br>

/etc/passwd<br>
/etc/group<br>
/etc/shadow<br>
/etc/login.defs<br>
/etc/gshadow<br>
/etc/login.defs<br>
